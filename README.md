# Content and UI Pattern Library

User Interface Design patterns are recurring solutions that solve common design problems. 
Content Patterns are standard reference points for the experienced user interface designer.

Content Patterns provide a common language between designers. 
They allow for debate over alternatives, where merely mentioning the name of a 
content pattern implicitly carries much more meaning than just the name.

## Contribution

This library is work in progress.
Actually, it is in a very early stage, and needs your help.

To contribute, 

  - Fork this repository, add your pattern(s), modify existing patterns, add resources ...
  - For the Content Patterns please use the [template](template.md), so the pattern descriptions all follow the same structure.
  - Resize screenshots to 50% of the original size, and crop away as much as possible.
  - Name the screenshots according to the pattern, suffixed by number, and place them in the `img` directory of the pattern group.
    Example: `img/paragraph-1.png`, `img/paragraph-2.png`, `img/paragraph-3.png` for images showing the Paragraph' pattern.
