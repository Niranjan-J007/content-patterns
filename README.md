# Content and UI Patterns

User Interface Design patterns are recurring solutions that solve common design problems. 
Content Patterns are standard reference points for the experienced user interface designer.

Content Patterns provide a common language between designers. 
They allow for debate over alternatives, where merely mentioning the name of a 
content pattern implicitly carries much more meaning than merely the name.
