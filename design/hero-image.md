# Hero Image

Hero image is a term used in web design for a specific type of web banner.
A hero image is a large banner image, prominently placed on a web page, generally in the front and center.
The hero image is often the first visual a visitor encounters on the site and its purpose is to present an overview of the site's most important content.
A hero image often consists of image and text, can be static or dynamic (e.g. a rotating list of images and/or topics).

The content presented varies with the purpose of the site:
it can be relevant news about the site, specific site-links, or - in the case of e-commerce - the best-selling or strategically placed products or services.
